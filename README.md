By the way, business cat doesn't have any copyrights, any copyrights for gdisasters would be in the files yet there is none, therefore there is no dmca take down, even so they would belong to harry who left the community before. If theres any mass reports to ban this project, I will get in contact with github to reverse it, checkmate.
